# c_programming
These are codes i learned during my and within a few years after my M.Sc. degree.
I enjoyed learning the C programmming language a lot. During my third semester of M.Sc. degree 
we had a paper on computational programming. It took me nearly three weeks to learn C.
I would suggest all to learn C, because a lot of programming laguage and lots of software 
packages are written and can be written in C.
